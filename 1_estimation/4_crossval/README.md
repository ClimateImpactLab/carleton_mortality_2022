This folder contains all scripts necessary to replicate the cross-validation exercises shown in Table D5 and described in detail in Appendix D.7. 

- `admin_xval/` constructs estimates of the "leave-one-ADM1-out" cross-validation shown in panel B of Table D5
- `covar_xval/` constructs estiamtes of the "leave-one-subsample-out" cross-validation shown in panel C of Table D5 and plots Figure D9
- `time_xval/` constructs estimates of the "leave-one-period-out" cross-validation shown in panel D of Table D5 and plots Figure D10
